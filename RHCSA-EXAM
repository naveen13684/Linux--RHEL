RHEL 7 RHCSA Exam Questions and Answers
November 26, 2016

1)  Reset Root Password ?

=> This is the first and  very important Question in RHCSA exam. If  you will not able to reset password then its not possible to get into the machine and solve other question.

a. Enter Emergency Mode
    - Reboot and enter grub edit menu by pressing the 'e' button
    - Find the linux16 or linuxefi line and add rd.break selinux=0 to the end of the line
    - Start the boot process by pressing CTRL+x

b. Reset the password
    - Remount the sysroot file system in r/w mode and then use chroot at /sysroot
      ─────────────────────────────
   ~]# mount -o remount,rw  /sysroot
   ~]# chroot /sysroot
   ─────────────────────────────

    - Change the password
      ──────
   ~]# passwd

  Exit from the shell and reboot system for login with root using new password.

2) Set network settings and hostname ?

=>  a. Configure Network

   The easiest/fastest way to do this is to use the nmtui command.

     b. Set hostname
      
  ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME


3) Set SELinux into enforcing mode ?

=>  ~]#  setenforce enforcing 

      ~]# vi /etc/selinux/config

      Edit line starting with SELINUX=enforcing

4) Enable yum repository.

=> Configure the machine to access a yum repo at server.example.com/repo

a. Create repo file /etc/yum.repos.d/yum.repo

   Contents:
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  [update]
  name=update
  baseurl=http://server.example.com/repo
  gpgcheck=0
  enabled=1
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────

b. Verify that your new repo is available.

   ~]# yum repolist

c. Verify access to the repo by installing something
   
   ~]# yum install system-config-*

5) User creation.

=>  Create 3 users - larry, curly, and moe.
All 3 users belong to supplemental group stooges.
User moe should have a shell of nologin

You'll need to pay attention to the wording here. The instructions say the users have to belong to a supplemental group stooges - that means they need to also belong to a primary group. The most logical assumption is that they each belong to their own private group (ex. larry:larry, curly:curly, etc…)

~]# groupadd stooges
~]# useradd larry  -G stooges
~]# useradd curly -G stooges
~]# useradd moe -s /bin/nologin -G stooges

6) Create a shared folder ?

=> Create a directory that members of the stooges group can access.
Ensure that files created in the directory are owned by the stooges group.

The solution is to use the SGID bit on the directory
────────────────────────────────────────────────
~]# mkdir /shared
~]# chown :stooges /shared
~]# chmod g+s /shared OR chmod 2775 /shared
────────────────────────────────────────────────

7) Activate and start services via systemctl ?

=> In exam you will ask to activate and start any service. Here, Iam enabling GUI target.
   ~]#  systemctl enable graphical.target
 ~]# systemctl start graphical.target

8)  Find all files owned by user bob and copy them to a newly created directory /tmp/bobs_files ?

=> We can do this using find command

     ~]# mkdir /tmp/bobs_files
  ~]# find / -user bob | xargs -I {} cp {} /tmp/bobs_files/

9) Find strings matching xyz in the file /tmp/test-log-file and save them in /tmp/matching-log-entries ?

=> ~]# grep xyz /tmp/test-log-file > /tmp/matching-log-entries

10) Create a gzipped tar archive (/tmp/log_archive.tgz) containing all the files in /var/log ?

=>  ~]# tar -zcvf /tmp/log_archive.tgz /var/log

11) Use ACLs on files ?

=> Create file /tmp/acl_file.
      The file is owned by bob:bob.
      Allow larry and curly to rwx the file.
      Don’t allow moe to access the file (rwx).
      All member of stooges (except moe) should be able to access the file (rw).

 a. Create the file
    
  ~]# touch /tmp/acl_file
  

b. Set the ownership
    
  ~]# chown bob:bob /tmp/acl_file
  

c. Allow larry/curly access
    
  ~]# setafcl -m u:larry:rwx /tmp/acl_file
  ~]# setafcl -m u:curly:rwx /tmp/acl_file
  

d. Deny moe access
    
  ~]# setfacl -m u:moe:- /tmp/acl_file
  

e. Allow members of stooges access
    
  ~]# setfacl -m g:stooges:rw  /tmp/acl_file
  

12) Update the kernel via new YUM-repo ?

=> A kernel update is available in a different location (not the first yum repo). 
      In exam you will get the location of the kernel where it is store accordingly create yum repo for that.

     a. Create a yum repo for the new location (refer to question #4)

     b. Issue the command to update the kernel
     
  ~]# yum update kernel

    c. Reboot to enable new kernel (Edit the entry in the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file to set new kernel as default)
    
  ~]# reboot
  
13) Create a Cronjob for bob that runs /bin/date daily at 3:18pm and redirects the output to /home/bob/stamp ?

=> a. Modify bob crontab entry
    
  ~]# crontab -eu bob
  
     b. Add the command

 18 15 * * * /bin/date >> /home/bob/stamp

14) Create a new 800MiB swap partition ?

=>  In exam probably you will get single disk with 3 partitions
      P1 - Boot
      P2 - LVM
      P3 - LVM

The question didn't specify that the new swap partition had to be part of the LVM so the easiest way to do this is to create another partition to use as a swap partition.

a. Use fdisk to create the partition (use +800M for Last Sector)
b. Issue the command blkid to get the UUID for the newly created disk
c. Add an entry to fstab (ex. UUID=<blkid-output> swap swap 0 0)
d. Issue the command swapon -a to enable the newly added partition

15) Create a new logical volume cattle with a size of 25 extents belonging to volume group farming with a PE size of 32M ?

=> a. Create a new PV
    This is where we would create a new partition with fdisk  or parted and after that create physical volume.
    Here, I am assuming you have created new partition /dev/sda3
    ~]# pvcreate /dev/sda3   

b. Create a new VG
    Use the vgcreate command with the flags:
     -s or --physicalextentsize set to 32M
   ~]# vgcreate -s 32M farming /dev/sda3

c. Create new LV
    Use lvcreate with the flags:
    -n or --name to provide the name
    -l or --extents to provide the size
   ~]# lvcreate -l 25 farming -n cattle


d. Create filesystem on the new Logical Volume.
    ~]# mkfs.ext4 /dev/farming/cattle

e. Mount LV and add an entry to fstab.
    ~]# mkdir /cattle
    ~]# mount /dev/farming/cattle /cattle
    ~]# vi /etc/fstab
         /dev/farming/cattle   /cattle    ext4     defaults   0 0


16) Create a connection to LDAP ?

=> LDAP is used for users and authentication

     A certificate is required (available for download)

    ~]# yum install -y openldap-clients nss-pam-ldapd
    ~]# authconfig --enableforcelegacy --update
    ~]# authconfig --enableldap --enableldapauth --enableldapserver="server.example.com" --ldapbasedn="dc=example,dc=com" --update
    
    To enable creation of Home directories if not exist:

   ~]# yum install oddjob-mkhomedir
   ~]# authconfig --enablemkhomedir

    Put the LDAP server certificate into the /etc/openldap/cacerts directory:

    ~]# scp root@server.example.com:/etc/openldap/certs/cert.pem /etc/openldap/certs/cacert/cert.pem
    ~]# restorecon /etc/openldap/certs/cert.pem

     To enable TLS
    ~]# authconfig --enableldaptls --update
   
     Testing configuration
    ~]# getent passwd ldapuser01
   

17) Use the NFS-automounter to get home directory mounted ?

=>  ~]# yum install -y autofs nfs-utils

      ~]# vi /etc/auto.master
            /home/guests /etc/auto.misc

       ~]# vi /etc/auto.misc
            * -rw,nfs4 server.example.com:/home/guests/&

        ~]# systemctl enable autofs
        ~]# systemctl start autofs

        Test Configuration.
        ~]# su - ldapuser01
  
        

18) Configure NTP to synchronize with time.example.com ?

=> a. Add the entry to /etc/chrony.conf
      ~]# vi /etc/chrony.conf
            server time.example.com

     b. Restart the service and ensure it's enabled (systemctl)
      ~]# systemctl restart chronyd

     c. Query chrony to verify (chronyc sources -v) o/p should display time.example.com
     ~]# chronyc sources -v

Thank you for the post , but there are some Qs needs modifications , such as 
1- selinux=0 means it's disabled which requires you to re label whole hard disk on next boot which is very time consuming.

2- No Need to edit /boot/grub2/grub.conf .. it's not even recommended to do it . 

Instead /etc/default/grub && grub2-mkconfig

OpenLDAP with Kerberos authentication and NFS in RHEL/CENTOS7
Introduction
In this article we are going to configure OpenLDAP with Kerberos as authentication mechanism and  we will configure autofs to automount  directories on client's. 
I recommend to refer my previous article of How to configure LDAP server. 
1) Configuring Kerberos 
Kerberos is the protocol for authenticating service requests between trusted hosts across an untrusted network. It is the default authentication mechanism in Windows OS. Almost all OS supports kerberos authentication. 

As shown in above screen edit krb5.conf file and replace example.com with  your ldap domain also change kdc server name with your ldap server. 
Next, file in which we need to made changes is kdc.conf file. Here, just change realms from example.com to your ldap domain.We are using linux.com as shown bellow: 


Last file we need to change is kadm5.acl here also change from example.com to linux.com as shown bellow: 


After making changes in configuration files we have to create database for kerberos i.e. kdb databas…
 
OpenLDAP Server Configuration RHEL/Centos 7
IntroductionOpenLDAP is an open source implementation of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. I am starting series of LDAP configuration in which will explain how to configure LDAP server, authenticate users through LDAP. It is going to be very interesting series and every Linux administrator must have a knowledge on LDAP configuration.

1) Installing OpenLDAP Packages.


~]# yum install -y openldap* migrationtools 
This will install packages required for Openldap server configuration. Migrationtools is a set of scripts which we require to convert local users and groups in ldif format.After installing above packages run bellow command and set password for LDAP admin.  
~]# slappasswdAfter running above command you will get your password in encrypted format just copy that password for future reference. 
2) Configuring LDAP Server. 
Important configuration file: i) olcDatabase={0}config.ldif ii) olcDatabase={1}monitor.ldif iii) olcDatabase={2}hdb.ldif 
Above three files are the main configuration files…
