1) On hosting machine, in file explorer, go to

Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Windows Firewall\Allowed apps

The above path is for windows 8, other windows version may differ slightly.

Look for application name (eg. Virtual Box is "Oracle VM VirtualBox"). There are 3 check boxes for the application, 
check mark them all, restart your app and it should work.

2) Make sure you select Bridged network in Adapter settings of VM

3) Disable SELinux to use websites outside Virtual box

4) Add firewall exception to port and service using firewall-cmd commands

5) tip : use different adapter for each machine, you have 4 adapter in OracleVirtual box., DHCP will not work if you same adapter
each VM will get same address.
